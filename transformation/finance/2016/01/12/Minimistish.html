  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I have always had a problem keeping things, and really that is getting rid of things. I am finding that this inability to dispose of things alters the way I feel about my life. When we got engaged we started looking really hard at our finances. Before I begin, we didn’t have any major debt beyond one car loan. Most of our “financial issues” were related to not having a solid plan, and thus excess posessions and a little lifestyle inflation have prevailed.</p>

<p>We decided to give the <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/store/financial-peace-university/financial-peace-university-home-study-kit/prod163.html?ictid=ZN67X366">Dave Ramsey’s Financial Peace University</a> a whirl. With the tools, we built out our budget of things we pay for, and had some serious discussions about how much money we want to save. With that information, we started cutting out some of the things that we deemed “low value”. We transferred all of our regular payments to one credit card (paid off monthly) and went to a cash budget for food and fun.</p>

<p>We started by filtering new purchases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we buy this, where will we put it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we started examining existing items.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Realistically, when is the next time we will use this, and is there an alternative?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We got rid of clothes, video games, and trinkets by selling, donating, or trashing. We stopped going to stores without a specific goal in mind, and we began only purchasing clothes that fit perfectly and felt good. We started to have a PLAN.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before we realized how much time and money was spent cleaning and organizing <em>things</em>. This was compounded when we had to rush to make our apartment look tidy for guests.</p>

<p>With our new found time and money, we decided to invest in our fitness. We joined the local gym and started meeting with a personal trainer to help us understand how to build a workout that works for our goals. While on this adventure, we discovered the health benefits of cooking more. It was the fitness that helped us get started with cooking, and our pocket book realized the benefits almost immediately. The savings on food completely paid for our gym membership and the trainer.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, my wife read some of <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache’s</a> blog, and we started to realize how living more simply can really reduce a lot of stress and free up funds for saving. MMM helped us to focus on financial independence, that we don’t <em>need</em> to work. His post on the <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/">Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement</a> tells us that if we save 15% we will need to work 43 years, but if we can save 50% we will only need to work 17. As we have worked hard to achieve this level of financial freedom, we have gained more confidence at work to achieve the career goals we really want.</p>

<p>Recently, I saw the TED Talk [left] for <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/">The Minimalists</a>. Their methods seem quite aggressive, but they do have me thinking about the <em>things</em> and what their purpose is.</p>

<p>During our winter break we finally “unpacked” the remaining boxes that have been waiting for us for over a year. We found so many things that we forgot we had. We donated or trashed nearly half of it. I remember some things, old movies that are freely available through our content subscriptions, some books not worth re-reading, clothes that don’t fit, and a ton of things that aren’t even other people’s treasures.</p>

<p>TV Free January has already been more productive. Perhaps I will be able to release some more posessions and free myself from some additional burdens.</p>

<p>A parting minimalist challenge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop buying the unnecessary.<br />
Toss half your stuff, learn contentedness.<br />
Reduce half again.<br />
List 4 essential things in your life, do these first,<br />
stop doing the non-essential.<br />
Clear distractions, focus on each moment.<br />
Let go of attachment to doing, having more.</p>

  <p>Fall in love with less.<br />
