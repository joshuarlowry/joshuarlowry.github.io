  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I have now been on vacation for two solid weeks, and it is approximately three hours till 2016. With Champaigne (cough <em>Sparkling Wine</em>) in hand, I write this post. We will continue with our tradition of TV Free January (Netflix, HULU, and Prime), where we vow to do better things with our time.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish these “better things” my wife and I sat down and authored a document to help us realize our long term goals. We made a 20 year outlook for our finances and made plans for how we would save this year to stay on track. We decided on vacations (and budgets), plans for home improvement and major purchases, and narrowed down our monthly budget to <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/10/19/pay-yourself-first/">pay ourselves first</a>! We also created a handy <a href="/tools/groceries/">Static Grocery List</a> which we will use to help us keep our grocery purchases in check.</p>

<p>After gaining a better understanding of our financial goals we moved into our personal goals for the year. You will see that a large component of my goals relate to fitness, socialization, and education. In 2016 I want to stop being a <a href="https://vimeo.com/99498062">Couchlandrian</a>! Here are some of mine. We tried to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">S.M.A.R.T Template</a></p>

<h4 id="goal-increase-my-physical-fitness-and-lose-weight">Goal: Increase my physical fitness and lose weight.</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Perform 45 minutes a day of physical exercise of at least a walk 5 days a week and participate in Cycling Training Rides (1 per week). Consult with Health Coach and Personal Trainer.</li>
  <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> 180 pounds by 2017 (currently 200 pounds) and Daily 45 Minute Goal with a cycling training ride.</li>
  <li><strong>Attainable:</strong> I used to do this, and I want to do it again.</li>
  <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> I am heavily invested in cycling, and I find it relaxing.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-Bound:</strong> Measured Weekly</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goal-increase-participation-in-cycling-community">Goal: Increase participation in cycling community.</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Maintain Energy Riders Training Series Website</li>
  <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> 2 Hours Minimum Per Week</li>
  <li><strong>Attainable:</strong> Yes, assuming TV is not available</li>
  <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Participating in the Energy Riders Training Series is one of my primary hobbies, and cycling is a focal point for my fitness goals.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-Bound:</strong> Series ends in April.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goal-learn-more-about-user-experience-design">Goal: Learn more about User Experience Design</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Watch two <a href="http://aycl.uie.com/">All You Can Learn</a> talks per week.</li>
  <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Two per week sounds pretty easy.</li>
  <li><strong>Attainable:</strong> My company pays for them, and I will watch them.</li>
  <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> These videos will help me learn more skills for my work.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-Bound:</strong> Currently there are 242 seminars, I will be on track to watch 104 of them in one year.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goal-work-on-fun-coding-projects-with-others">Goal: Work on fun coding projects with others.</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Specific:</strong> For 5 hours per week, work on coding projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> 5 hours is pretty lean.</li>
  <li><strong>Attainable:</strong> TV holds me back on this.</li>
  <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Coding projects are constrained only by our imagination (and of course our time….), note: bring imagination.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-Bound:</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goal-entertain-guests-at-our-house">Goal: Entertain guests at our house.</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Host an event with 2-10 guests once per month and make simple snacks like mini cupcakes or popcorn to keep it light.</li>
  <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> As simple as a small game night to a large movie night.</li>
  <li><strong>Attainable:</strong> We could probably do it more!</li>
  <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Entertaining is fun, it can be healthy, and even with snacks is pretty cheap.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-Bound:</strong> Once per month for this year, or more if we can manage it.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goal-one-chore-per-day">Goal: One Chore Per Day</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Pick one chore per day from the household chore list. If it leads to more than one, that is a win!</li>
  <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Just ONE!</li>
  <li><strong>Attainable:</strong> Most chores take 20 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Keeping the house tidy and clean reduces our stress and allows us to feel productive and focus on our other goals.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-Bound:</strong> ONE PER DAY!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goal-tabletop-gaming-day">Goal: Tabletop Gaming Day</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Play the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords">Rise of the Runelords Campaign</a> once per month at least.</li>
  <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Gaming days take a whole day.</li>
  <li><strong>Attainable:</strong> Prep work has been reduced down to an hour or two with the help of <a href="http://www.wolflair.com/legacy/index.php?context=hero_lab&amp;page=pathfinder_roleplaying_game">HeroLab</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Rise of the Runelords is fun and challenging for me to host.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-Bound:</strong> Eventually the campaign will be over, and I will have to find new campaigns to play.</li>
</ul>
